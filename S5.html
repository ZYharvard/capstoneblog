<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">5.2 </span>Future Work</h2>

<div id="SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Throughout this project, we have developed a data-driven solution for identifying abnormal commodity prices in local areas, with the ultimate goal of maximizing farm profitability. Due to the limitations of time and scope during the course of this capstone project, there are several potential future directions that could be pursued for further enhancement and exploration.</p>

<section id="SS2.SSS1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.2.1 </span>Modeling</h3>

<div id="SS2.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the realm of modeling, the journey towards optimal commodity price optimization is an ongoing process. While we have made significant strides in developing a framework for anomaly detection and maximizing profitability for farmers, there are still various avenues for further exploration and improvement. The future of our modeling efforts lies in harnessing the power of advanced techniques such as the Merlion model and the diffusion/heat equation. These approaches offer promising possibilities for refining our predictions, enhancing anomaly detection capabilities, and ultimately providing more accurate and actionable insights to our clients. By delving into these modeling frontiers, we can continue to push the boundaries of our framework and unlock even greater potential for optimizing commodity prices in the dynamic agricultural market.</p>
<ol id="I1" class="ltx_enumerate">

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">1.</span> 
<div id="I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Merlion Model:</span> The Merlion framework developed by Salesforce provides a wide range of time series forecasting and anomaly detection tools. Some of its key features include support for various data types (such as numerical, categorical, and text), a modular architecture for easy customization and extension, and a suite of pre-built models for quick deployment. Given its versatility and scalability, the Merlion model could be a valuable addition to the current optimization framework. Specifically, it could be used to generate more accurate predictions for commodity prices or to identify anomalous price patterns that could impact farm profitability.</p>

<div id="I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Diffusion/Heat Equation:</span> Another area of interest for future work could be to explore the use of diffusion/heat equation models for commodity price forecasting. These models are commonly used in physics and engineering to describe the behavior of physical systems that exhibit diffusion, such as the spread of heat or chemical substances. In the context of commodity price forecasting, these models could be used to describe how price fluctuations propagate across different geographic regions or markets. By incorporating information about diffusion rates and market interconnectivity, such models could provide more accurate predictions of commodity prices and help farmers make more informed decisions about their operations.</p>

<div id="I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Automatic Model Selection:</span> With an increasing number of models embedded in the system, it becomes crucial to have a mechanism that can automatically choose the most appropriate model for a given elevator or location. This tool could leverage techniques such as Bayesian optimization or model comparison based on performance metrics to evaluate and select the best-performing model. By automating the model selection process, the framework can adapt to different scenarios and ensure that the most accurate and effective model is used for each specific case. This would enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, allowing for better decision-making and optimization of commodity prices for farmers.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">5.2.2 </span>Productization</h3>

<div id="SS2.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As we look towards the future, it is essential to consider the productization of our framework, ensuring that it becomes a practical and accessible tool for our clients. While the focus of our capstone project has been on modeling and optimizing commodity prices, the next phase involves transforming our solution into a fully functional and user-friendly product. This entails developing a range of productization strategies, such as implementing real-time notifications, creating a user-friendly interface, and integrating with existing farm management software. These future works aim to enhance the usability, scalability, and efficiency of the tool, empowering our clients to make informed decisions and maximize farm profitability. By taking these steps, we can bridge the gap between sophisticated modeling techniques and practical applications, delivering a valuable and user-centric solution to our clients in the agricultural industry.</p>

<div id="I2.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Real-time Notifications:</span> Implementing real-time notifications is a crucial future work that would significantly enhance the effectiveness of our framework. Currently, the reports are generated on a daily basis, but by developing a system capable of monitoring commodity prices in real-time, we can promptly alert clients when abnormal prices are detected. This real-time notification feature ensures that clients stay informed and can make timely decisions to maximize their farm profitability. By leveraging advanced data processing and communication technologies, we can create a robust and efficient real-time notification system that keeps clients updated on market fluctuations and potential opportunities.</p>

<div id="I2.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">User-friendly Interface:</span> Developing a user-friendly interface is essential to enhance the usability and accessibility of our framework. While our current PDF reports provide valuable insights, they may not be the most accessible format for all clients. By creating a web-based interface, we can offer a more interactive and visually appealing platform that allows clients to explore the data, visualize trends, and customize their analysis. Incorporating features such as interactive maps, dynamic graphs, and intuitive filters empowers clients to interact with the information more effectively and gain deeper insights. By incorporating user feedback and iterative design processes, we can ensure that the interface is intuitive, tailored to the specific needs of clients, and enhances their overall experience.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">3.</span> 
<div id="I2.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Integration with Existing Farm Management Software:</span> Integrating our framework with existing farm management software, such as FarmLogs, Agworld, or Granular, represents a significant step towards seamless and efficient workflows for our clients. By integrating our solution into their existing software systems, we eliminate the need for manual data transfer and streamline the entire process. This integration enables clients to access our framework and its insights directly within their familiar farm management platforms, ensuring a cohesive and efficient user experience. Through effective integration, we can create a comprehensive solution that seamlessly combines commodity price optimization with other essential farm management functionalities, enabling clients to make data-driven decisions and manage their operations more efficiently.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="ltx_p">In conclusion, with a solid foundation established by our current framework, we are well-positioned to efficiently implement future works that will further enhance our capabilities in optimizing commodity prices for farmers. The advancements we seek to pursue, such as real-time notifications, a user-friendly interface, and integration with existing farm management software, can be seamlessly integrated into our framework, leveraging the existing infrastructure and expertise we have developed. This streamlined approach allows us to build upon our current successes and efficiently incorporate new features and functionalities that address the evolving needs of our clients. By leveraging the robust foundation we have laid, we can efficiently implement these future works and continue to provide our clients with cutting-edge tools and insights that maximize farm profitability.</p>
